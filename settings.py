Game Settings and Configuration
==============================
This file contains all the important settings and constants for our game.
In programming, it's good practice to keep all configuration values in one place!

Educational Concepts:
- Constants and global variables
- Dictionaries for organizing data
- Coordinate systems and positioning
- Game design parameters
